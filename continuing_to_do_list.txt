>> people info sidebar/popup

how? 
- if sidebar:
	- select the relevant dom elements and fill them appropriately
	( ? can one preselect dom elements? store them as a variable? -> test! )
	- fill them
	
- if pop-up:
	- add the popup rendering at the end of the rendering que
	- otherwise pretty much the same as the above
	
	
	
>> (what else?)
- visual design
- spacing positioning of terms and people names
-
